### Introduction

This demonstration aims to practice that create a simple web application using AWS Amplify.
I have built and host a React application on AWS and initialize a local app using the CLI, add authentication, add a GraphQL API and database, and update the app to store images.

##[Click to the APP](https://master.d234mxzhwl60mw.amplifyapp.com/)

ToDo:
- Initialize the Amplify app
- Authentication: Add auth to your app to activate sign-in and sign-out
- Database and storage: Add a GraphQL API, database, and storage solution

### Installation
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
